@article{Stuart2004,
	Abstract = {Corporate rebranding is a strategy used by companies to change their image. There may be very good reasons for doing this, the most obvious being to send a signal to stakeholders that something about the organisation has changed (for the better). Other less pressing reasons, discussed in this paper, are, however, also instigators for rebranding. To some extent, a corporate makeover appears to contradict what has long been regarded as standard marketing practice in product branding, that is, long-term investment in and commitment to a brand. Despite this, many firms are undertaking corporate rebranding exercises. The cost of corporate rebranding is very high, running into millions of dollars in many cases. In this paper, the concept of rebranding is discussed, the motivations for corporate rebranding are categorised, and the main issues in corporate rebranding in relation to rebranding the name, logo and slogan are discussed. Lastly the effectiveness of corporate rebranding as a corporate strategy is evaluated.},

@article{Lees-Marshment2001,
	Abstract = { Research into major party behaviour in Britain from a political marketing perspective finds that political marketing is broad in scope and offers fresh analytical tools to explain how political organizations behave. It is nevertheless a marriage between political science and marketing. It borrows the core marketing concepts of product, sales and market-orientation, and techniques such as market intelligence, and adapts them to suit traditional tenets of political science to produce an integrated theoretical framework. A party that takes a product-orientation argues for what it stands for and believes in. A Sales-Orientated party focuses on selling its argument and product to voters. A Market-Orientated party designs its behaviour to provide voter satisfaction. Exploring these three orientations demonstrates that political marketing can be applied to a wide range of behaviour and suggests its potential to be applied to several areas of political studies. },

@article{Kim2017,
	Abstract = { Contrary to longstanding arguments that equate parties with durable, information-rich brand names, the relabeling of parties is not rare, and in many countries it is not even very unusual. This paper provides the first effort to document this neglected phenomenon. It finds that across European democracies roughly a third of all parties have relabeled themselves at least once since 1945, and a similar proportion of elections include at least one party running under a new name. It then presents analyses of why parties change names more frequently in some circumstances, finding support for three explanations derived from the existing literature: parties with longer-standing brands are less likely to shed them, but relabeling is more likely for parties that suffer electoral setbacks and for parties in weaker party systems. Finally, it presents evidence that the end of Soviet communism made left parties more likely to rename themselves. },
